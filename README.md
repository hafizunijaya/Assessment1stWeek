For Back End Assessment, 
1. You are required to do CRUD functions using User Model (Login & Register is not consider as CRUD) // done
2. The CRUD functions need to be ​REST API // done
3. Your API can only be accessed if user is authenticated through ​Laravel Passport // partial due to not knowing how to apply/give token
4. All of your inputs need to be validated. (php artisan make:request) // using validate = [$request]
5. You are also required to filter and have pagination when getting all users and when retrieving the data,
only need to show name and email using transformer. (php artisan make:resource) // not able
6. You also need to have a function to import excel/csv files to Create, Update and Delete users.

2. The web app can do the CRUD functions on Post Model //only the function available, but couldnt not make it work since the first one
3. You are also required to handle the response callback if the response return errors or fail validation. (It
is not a front-end validation, you need to do AJAX handling response) // using validate = [$request]
